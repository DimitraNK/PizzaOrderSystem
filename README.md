# PizzaOrderSystem
Two versions of a pizza ordering system.  
Folder v1: this system assigns orders to cooks, prepares, bakes and calculates how much time was needed for the completion of the order. It also calculaters the average time needed to complete cooking an order and prints how much time the longest order required to be completed.  
Folder v2: In addition to everything described above, this system also delivers pizzas and calculates the average time needed to complete cooking an order, as well as the average waiting time for someone to deliver an order and prints how much time the order that required the longest time needed to be completed.
